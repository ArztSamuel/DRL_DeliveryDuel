# Unity ML-Agents (Beta)

**Unity Machine Learning Agents** (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin 
that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training
intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning,
imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through
a simple-to-use Python API. We also provide implementations (based on
TensorFlow) of state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers
and hobbyists to easily train intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games.
These trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including
controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and
adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game
design decisions pre-release. ML-Agents is mutually beneficial for both game
developers and AI researchers as it provides a central platform where advances
in AI can be evaluated on Unity’s rich environments and then made accessible
to the wider research and game developer communities. 

## Features
* Unity environment control from Python
* 10+ sample Unity environments
* Support for multiple environment configurations and training scenarios
* Train memory-enhanced Agents using deep reinforcement learning
* Easily definable Curriculum Learning scenarios
* Broadcasting of Agent behavior for supervised learning
* Built-in support for Imitation Learning
* Flexible Agent control with On Demand Decision Making
* Visualizing network outputs within the environment
* Simplified set-up with Docker (Experimental)

## Documentation and References

**For more information, in addition to installation and usage
instructions, see our [documentation home](docs/Readme.md).** If you have
used a version of ML-Agents prior to v0.3, we strongly recommend 
our [guide on migrating to v0.3](docs/Migrating-v0.3.md).
